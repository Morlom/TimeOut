# TimeOut
<h3>App to restrict user's time on PC</h3>
<br>
<h4>An app written in Python to limit computer usage time for the user. I couldn't find any working app that limits active time instead of predefined operating hours. That's why I wrote it</h4>
<br>
<h4>This is also my first big app and also my first GUI app, so there may be some bugs</h4>
<hr><br>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<h4>Extract the appropriate archive to a safe folder and run TimeOut.exe</h4>
<h4>Note that the application will not work without the icon file</h4>
<h4>If you forget the app password, simply delete the "data" file next to the executable and restart your computer</h4>
<hr><br>
<h3>To do</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Changing language in the app settings + support for other languages</li>
  <li>Reduce RAM consumption</li>
  <li>Splitting the code into smaller modules</li>
  <li>Linux version</li>
  <li>Potential bugs</li>
</ul>
<hr><br>
<h3>You are free to use and edit the code, but do not distribute it to other sites</h3>
