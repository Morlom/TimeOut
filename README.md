# TimeOut
<h3>App to restrict user's time on the PC</h3>
<br>
<h4>An application written in Python to limit computer usage time for the user. I couldn't find any working application that limits active time instead of predefined operating hours</h4>

<h4>This is also my first big app and also my first GUI app, so there may be some bugs</h4>
<hr><br>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<h4>Extract the appropriate archive to a safe folder and run TimeOut.exe</h4>
<h4>Note that the application will not work without the icon file</h4>

<h3>To do</h3>

  <li>Potential bugs</li>
